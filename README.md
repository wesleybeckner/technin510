## Course Objectives
This course enables students to build digital and physical user interfaces to bring their ideas to life. Students will first enhance their fundamental programming skills and learn web programming languages to develop various browser-based interactive applications. Next they will learn to process events and continuous data streams from different sensors, including touchscreens, microphones, cameras, motion sensors, and wearables. They will learn different UI programming patterns and modern tools and services that support UI development. They will also practice intuitive UI design principles. Through a sequence of assignments they will produce an interactive system that fully integrates all digital and physical interfaces practiced in the course. They will learn best practices for evaluating digital and physical UIs as well as for presenting interactive systems.

At the end of this course students should:

* Feel confident that they can build anything they know is possible
* Have accurate expectations about what is possible with current technology
* Feel excited about being involved in technical development
* Be able to create interactive websites and web applications
* Be able to access and process sensor data from touchscreens, microphones, cameras, motion sensors, wearables
* Be able to use Google Cloud Services
* Have a working knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript
* Have a working knowledge of Python and Jupyter Notebooks
* Be aware of different web programming platforms and resources for learning about them
* Be aware of different programming models for UI development
* Be able to test and demonstrate interactive systems they have built

## Course Structure and Rules
* The class times will be used for a mix of lectures, guided exercises, and labs. Most weeks the morning time will be used for the lecture and the afternoon will be used for labs.
* Labs will require a laptop on which the student can develop software.
* Students will get a chance to practice what they learn in class through an assignment sequence corresponding to milestones in an individual quarter project. The project will involve building a social robot to address a pressing societal problem or need. 
* All assignments are individual and should be completed by each student separately. Students are welcome to work together in solving problems and share hints with each other, as long as there is no direct copying of code or text. The goal is for everyone to be in the driving seat for their projects and acquire the programming skills that will be useful going forward in the program.
* Assignments will be posted on the Assignment page and submitted through Canvas. A rubric for the grading of each assignment will be available on Canvas. Assignments will be given on Wednesdays and due the next or the following Tuesday, as noted on the Calendar page.
* Students will have a total of 5 grace days to submit their assignments late at no penalty. If the student has used up all grace days, any assignment submitted after it has been graded for the rest of the class will get 50% penalty. Grading dates will be determined by the teaching assistants.
* For any questions regarding assignments or the class, students should use Canvas discussion boards.
* Students are welcome to email the teaching staff directly for any other questions or appointment requests.
* Students can submit anonymous feedback or suggestions about the course through Canvas at any time during the quarter. In addition, there will be a mid-quarter and end-of quarter request for feedback which will help fix anything that is not working and improve the class for future offerings.

## Grading
The grade distribution will be as follows:

* 45% Labs (9)

* 55% Project

  * 15% Milestone-1

  * 15% Milestone-2

  * 25% Final demo & video
