In summary, many independent scientific fields began accumulating large amounts of data. At the UW in particular, these were dominated by the astronomy and oceanography departments. Folks began to realize that they needed a particular set of tools to handle large amounts of data. This culminated in the [eScience studio](https://escience.washington.edu/), which began to service the data needs of many departments on campus.\n","\n","Today, data science not only has to do with large amounts of data, but refers generally to tools that allow us to work with a variety of data types. Because of this, machine learning is a tool within data science. But there are other tools apart from machine learning that makeup the data science ecosystem. Some of them are:\n","\n","* data visualization\n","* databases \n","* statistics\n","\n","You could argue for others as well (algorithms, web servers, programming, etc.), but these are the formally accepted areas.
