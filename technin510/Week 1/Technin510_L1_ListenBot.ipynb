Before entering the loop, your program should prompt the user to request their input (e.g. \"Hi, how can I help you?\"). At each iteration of the loop, the program should take user input (typed onto the terminal pressing 'Enter' at the end) and then output simple meta information about that input (e.g. \"You entered X letters and Y words\"). Also add a way to exit the loop; for example, if the user types \"Bye\" the loop should end and your program should halt after a final prompt to the user to acknowledge that the interaction has ended.

Before entering into the interactive loop, your chatbot should ask the user's name and remember it throughout the chat. It should also prompt the user to talk about something (e.g. \"How was your day, Ashitaka?\") As part of the loop, the chatbot should analyze the user's input and decide whether to give a positive, negative, or neutral response. To analyze the input, make a fixed list of [positive](http://ptrckprry.com/course/ssd/data/positive-words.txt) and [negative](http://ptrckprry.com/course/ssd/data/negative-words.txt) words and determine the number of positive and negative words that occur in the user's input.

Optionally you can download the lists linked above and load them into your program.\n","\n","The chatbot should respond based on the number of positive and negative words in the user's input. Your chatbot should have at least two different responses of each type and should alternate between responses, e.g.:\n","* Positive responses: \"Great\" \"Cool\"\n","* Negative responses: \"That sucks\" \"Bummer\"\n","* Neutral responses: \"Hmm..\" \"I see\"\n","\n","As before, there should be at least one way to end the conversation.
