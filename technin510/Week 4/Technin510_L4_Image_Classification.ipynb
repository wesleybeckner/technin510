The three functions you will need to implement are indicated with comments in the code.\n","\n","The first one of these is `extract_image_features` which should return a Numpy array that contains the features that represent the image. Before extracting any features, you should apply Gaussian blurring to your images to get rid of random sensor noice that is common in many lower cost cameras. For this, look into the filters module of scikit-image. Then explore at least two different types of features provided in the feature module of scikit-image. Inspect the size of the feature vectors generated by different methods and what the features look like for different images from the training or testing set. \n","\n","You will not yet get a good sense of how well each feature performs in allowing the classifiers to discriminate between different images. Hence, keep your code for extracting different features around until you explore classification performance in the next step.
